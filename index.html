    <p>The **T.A. Marryshow Community College (TAMCC)** is Grenada’s main publicly funded tertiary institution,
         formed through the merger of several post-secondary schools. 
         Its main campus is in Tanteen, St. George’s,
          with additional sites in Mirabeau, St. Andrew, Carriacou, and St. Patrick.
           TAMCC offers certificates, associate degrees, and some bachelor programmes in areas such as arts,
            sciences, teacher education, agriculture, applied arts, and technology.
             It also provides continuing education and technical-vocational training.
              The college is nationally accredited and plays a key role in workforce development,
               with partnerships in areas like ICT, creative industries, and climate-smart agriculture.
                Through collaborations with regional and international organizations,
                 TAMCC continues to expand opportunities for Grenadian students to access quality education and practical training.
